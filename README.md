# Hash Tables in Java

This project implements **open hashing (separate chaining)** and **closed hashing (open addressing)** in Java.

The implementation was developed as part of the *Algorithms and Data Structures* coursework and demonstrates a solid understanding of core data structure concepts.

## Features
- Open Hash Table using Linked Lists (Separate Chaining)
- Closed Hash Table with probing strategy
- Insert, search and remove operations
- Collision handling
- Time complexity considerations

## Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures & Algorithms

## Context
This project was implemented during the first semester of the Bachelor's program in **Wirtschaftsinformatik (B.Sc.)** and reflects practical work with fundamental algorithms and data structures.
